## 🚀 Our Project — Varuna Water Quality Monitor

**Varuna** is an AI-powered Android application that monitors water quality
in real-time using IoT hardware sensors. It predicts the **Water Quality Index (WQI)**
and assesses disease risks using a trained Random Forest ML model —
all running natively on Android with zero external ML dependencies.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 📡 **IoT Sensor Integration** — real-time hardware data input
- 🤖 **ML-based WQI Prediction** — Random Forest with 5 classifiers
- 🦠 **Disease Risk Assessment** — Cholera, Typhoid, Diarrhea
- 🔥 **Firebase Backend** — Auth, Firestore, Cloud Messaging
- 📄 **PDF Report Generation** — shareable water quality reports
- 🚨 **Real-time Alerts** — emergency notifications
